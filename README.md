# Concurrent-Red-Black-Trees

This version of the red-black tree is currently in the pre-alpha stage. 
It has been designed to handle multiple threads simultaneously, making parallel processing more efficient. 
Nevertheless, it's important to note that due to its early development stage, the data structure may not yet be stable or fully functional.
